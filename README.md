# patricjs
patric javascript - an extension to make javascript object orientated as an educational tool.
Originally patricjs was created as a web tool for drawing and making objects to use with programming languages like javascript, jquery and raphael js. Following on from this the aim was to make it a web based program for creating graphics either by defining the graphics on the screen from the RH menu and/or programming the graphics from the LH menu. It has developed into a particularly useful tool for teaching students the basics of programming. Spectacular graphics can be created and then exported as a .png file from the RH menu.
